# Google Login with Node.js and React

This project is a simple example of how to integrate Google login in a React app using Node.js as a backend server. It uses the 

#### `passport-google-oauth20` 
package for server-side authentication and the 
#### `react-google-login`

package for client-side authentication.

### Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js (version 12 or higher)

#### Google API Console project with the Google Sign-in API enabled

## Installing

1. Clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-login-node-react.git```

2. Install the dependencies for the server:
```
cd google-login-node-react/server

npm install
```

3. Create a .env file in the server directory with your Google client ID and client secret:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```
4. Start the server:

```npm start```

5. Install the dependencies for the client:

```
cd ../client
npm install
```

6. Create a .env file in the client directory with your Google client ID:

```REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id```

7. Start the client:

```npm start```

8. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

## Usage

To use the app, click on the "Login with Google" button to authenticate with your Google account. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the app's protected routes.
